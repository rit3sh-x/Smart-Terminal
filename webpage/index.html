Additionally, Smart Terminal includes a powerful version control system, supported by <code>OpenSSL</code> and custom <code>VersionManager</code> functionality, which tracks file changes over time and enables restoration to previous versions based on SHA1 hashing and timestamped versions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Internally, the file structure is represented as an <b>n-ary tree</b> for directory navigation, <b>tries</b> for file searching and autocompletion, and <b>linked lists</b> for efficient data handling. This integrated structure ensures a robust and efficient performance, making Smart Terminal an ideal solution for users who require an all-in-one terminal-based file management tool.
            </p>

            <h2 id="features">Features</h2>

            <h3 id="file-organization-and-navigation">File Organization and Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                The <b>Smart Terminal</b> application utilizes an N-ary tree structure to model a directory hierarchy, enabling efficient traversal, file operations, and user interaction. The file organization and navigation component offers the following core features:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>File and Folder Creation:</b> Users can create new files and folders within the directory tree. The system ensures unique names for each entity by checking existing entries and adding suffixes if necessary.</li>
                <li><b>Directory Navigation:</b> Implemented with <code>ncurses</code>, the terminal-based interface allows users to browse files and folders. Arrow keys facilitate movement through directory entries, allowing users to open subdirectories or return to parent directories.</li>
                <li><b>File Searching:</b> An inbuilt search function enables users to quickly locate files within the current directory using keyword-based search.</li>
                <li><b>Dynamic Directory Loading and Refreshing:</b> The directory tree is dynamically updated as users create or delete files, ensuring that displayed entries accurately reflect the current state of the file system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each of these functionalities is managed within the <code>DirectoryTree</code> and <code>FileExplorer</code> classes, which handle directory state, user interaction, and screen display.

            </figure>

            <h3 id="file-searching-autocomplete">File Searching &amp; Autocomplete</h3>
            <p>
                The <b>FileSearcher</b> class in <b>Smart Terminal</b> provides efficient file searching and autocomplete functionality using a Trie-based approach for indexing file paths. This feature allows users to quickly locate files and directories by entering partial names and obtaining relevant suggestions. Key components of this system include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Trie Data Structure:</b> The <code>Trie</code> and <code>TrieNode</code> classes are implemented to store file paths. Each character of a filename is represented as a node in the Trie, with complete paths stored at the end nodes. This enables fast prefix-based searches for autocompletion.</li>
                <li><b>File Insertion in Trie:</b> Upon initialization, the <code>buildTrie()</code> method recursively scans the specified directory and inserts file paths into the Trie. This process allows for efficient querying of paths based on user input.</li>
                <li><b>Autocomplete Suggestions:</b> As the user types in the search bar, <code>generateSuggestions()</code> queries the Trie for paths matching the current input prefix, displaying up to ten suggestions below the search bar.</li>
                <li><b>Search Execution and Result Display:</b> Upon pressing Enter, the program searches for files matching the input and displays the results in a scrollable format, allowing navigation using the arrow keys.</li>
            </ul>
            <figure>

            <h3 id="file-sharing">File Sharing (P2P/Torrent)</h3>
            <p>
                The <b>FileTransferClient</b> class within the <b>Smart Terminal</b> project is designed to enable peer-to-peer file sharing through sockets, incorporating features for IP decoding and file transfer via TCP. This class, along with a Base64 decoder for IP addresses and a simple UI, allows seamless file transfers between client and server. Key components are outlined as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Base64 Decoding for IP Addresses:</b> The <code>Base64Decoder</code> class converts encoded IP addresses from Base64 into the standard dotted-decimal format using a custom <code>decodeIP()</code> function. This enables obfuscated IPs to be decoded for secure communication within the client-server architecture.</li>
                <li><b>File Transfer Client:</b> The <code>FileTransferClient</code> class establishes a TCP connection to a server and transfers a specified file in binary mode. This is achieved by reading chunks of data and sending them over the socket, ensuring reliability in the file transmission process.</li>
                <li><b>Client User Interface (UI):</b> The <code>ClientUI</code> class, implemented with <code>ncurses</code>, provides a text-based interface where users can input the session ID for the file transfer and receive status messages. It manages screen interactions and displays messages, improving usability for end-users in the terminal environment.</li>

            <h3>SHA1 Algorithm</h3>
            <pre><code class="language-none">
Algorithm: SHA-1 Algorithm Pseudocode

Input: Message M of length L bits
Output: 160-bit hash H

Step 1: Pre-processing
    - Append the bit '1' to the end of M
    - Append k zero bits, where k is the smallest integer such that (L + 1 + k) mod 512 = 448
    - Append the 64-bit binary representation of L to M
    - Split M into N 512-bit blocks: M = M1, M2, ..., MN

Step 2: Initialize hash values
    Set initial hash values:
        H0 = 0x67452301
        H1 = 0xEFCDAB89
        H2 = 0x98BADCFE
        H3 = 0x10325476
        H4 = 0xC3D2E1F0

Step 3: Process each 512-bit block
    For each 512-bit block Mi:
        - Divide Mi into 16 words W[0], W[1], ..., W[15] of 32 bits each
        - For t = 16 to 79:
            W[t] = leftrotate(W[t-3] xor W[t-8] xor W[t-14] xor W[t-16], 1)
        - Initialize variables A, B, C, D, E with H0, H1, H2, H3, H4

        For t = 0 to 79:
            if 0 ≤ t ≤ 19:   f = (B and C) or (not B and D), k = 0x5A827999
            if 20 ≤ t ≤ 39:  f = B xor C xor D, k = 0x6ED9EBA1
            if 40 ≤ t ≤ 59:  f = (B and C) or (B and D) or (C and D), k = 0x8F1BBCDC
            if 60 ≤ t ≤ 79:  f = B xor C xor D, k = 0xCA62C1D6
            TEMP = leftrotate(A, 5) + f + E + k + W[t]
            E = D, D = C, C = leftrotate(B, 30), B = A, A = TEMP

        - Update hash values:
            H0 = H0 + A
            H1 = H1 + B
            H2 = H2 + C
            H3 = H3 + D
            H4 = H4 + E

Step 4: Produce the final hash
    Concatenate H0, H1, H2, H3, H4 to get the final 160-bit hash H
